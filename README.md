Linux flash tool for PCAN Routers

This tool can be used to flash PEAK System PCAN Routers as an alternative to the PCAN-Flash Windows application.

As it is possible to build firmware images for the PCAN Routers with Linux this pcanflash tool was the missing piece to provide a complete toolchain for Linux environments:

Scripts and documentation to build PCAN Router firmware with Linux can be found here: https://github.com/peak-system/pcanrouter

This programm is currently tested with the following PCAN hardware:

- PCAN Router
- PCAN Router DR
- PCAN Router Pro
- PCAN Router FD
- PCAN Router Pro FD
- PCAN MicroMod Analog2
- PCAN-MiniDiag FD

# REMARK

As there's no flow control when a flash block is transferred the tx-queue-len should be extendend. The default queue length for Linux is 10 frames - the PEAK Linux driver v8.1 sets the queue length to 50 frames.

A tx queue length of 500 CAN frames is recommended to run 'pcanflash' which can be set by the 'ip' tool from the iproute2 package or by sysfs:

- ip link set can0 txqueuelen 500

- echo 500 > /sys/class/net/can0/tx_queue_len

E.g.

ip link set can0 up type can bitrate 500000

ip link set can0 txqueuelen 500
